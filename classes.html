faq:
  - question: How do I know if I'm signed up for a class?
    answer: If you have completed the form and made your payment, you are signed up.  Sometimes schools don't update their class rosters frequently.  
  - question: A class has already started for this quarter.  Can I still join?
    answer: Generally, you can join up to a few weeks after the start if you are willing to put in the effort to catch up.
  - question: Can you offer classes at my organization?
    answer: Possibly, we are always looking for partner organizations if we have volunteer bandwidth.  Feel free to <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/contact/">contact us</a> with opportunities.
